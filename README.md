# MultiExcelFilterHtml

MultiExcelFilterHtml is a web-based project that enables users to upload multiple excel files and display filters for each shared column across all uploaded files. 

It's worth noting that MultiExcelFilterHtml can still function properly even if the columns of the excel files are different, as long as they share at least one column. 

The project is designed to run without the need for a server and has no dependencies except for the [xlsx library](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/xlsx).

The code is written in a clear and concise manner, making it easy to understand and modify.

With MultiExcelFilterHtml, you can quickly filter and display columns that match specific criteria. It is incredibly user-friendly and helpful for anyone who needs to work with multiple excel files and wants to easily filter and display the data.
